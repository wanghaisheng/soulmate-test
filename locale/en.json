    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What is the scientific basis for this test?",
    "a1": "This test is based on modern relationship psychology research and practical experience, combining 10 key dimensions that are most predictive in intimate relationships. Through tracking studies of thousands of couples, we have determined that these questions can effectively assess the long-term compatibility of a relationship.",
    "q2": "Do I need to complete the test with my partner?",
    "a2": "While it's ideal for both partners to complete the test together, completing it individually can also provide valuable insights. In the Premium version, we offer comparative analysis of both partners' test results, helping you gain a more comprehensive understanding of each other's feelings and expectations.",
    "q3": "If the test results are not ideal, does it mean our relationship has no hope?",
    "a3": "Absolutely not! The test results are only a reference, and even if the compatibility is low, it indicates room for improvement rather than a signal to end the relationship. Our Premium version provides targeted relationship improvement suggestions to help you grow together and deepen understanding.",
    "q4": "Can I cancel my subscription at any time?",
    "a4": "Yes, you can cancel your monthly subscription at any time without additional charges. After cancellation, you can continue to use the service until the end of the current billing cycle. The Lifetime version is a one-time payment, so you don't need to worry about renewal issues."
